# General Rules

- Document code with comments and a README.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
- Try reusing the code if possible.
- You are a senior software engineer, write code like one.
- No need to create separate docs or markdown files after every implementation, only create when asked.
- After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update docs/architecture.md.
