# TypeScript

- Use `async/await` over raw promises.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use explicit return types on exported functions.
- Define shared types in `src/types/`. Import from there, don't inline.
- Use `try/catch` with meaningful error messages. Never swallow errors silently.
- Use `import`/`export` (ESM style), not `require`.
