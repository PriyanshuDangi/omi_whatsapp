# API Test Artifact Sync

When adding or changing API endpoints in this project, always update both:

- `test-api-example.http`
- `test-api.mjs`

Required updates for new endpoints:

- Add at least one runnable request example to `test-api-example.http`.
- Add or update the matching script flow in `test-api.mjs`.
- Keep request paths, methods, required headers, and payload shapes aligned with route code.
- If an endpoint requires `uid`, include `uid` in both test files.
- Do not consider endpoint work complete until both test files are updated.
