# Omi WhatsApp Integration

This is a hackathon MVP — an Omi integration app that sends WhatsApp meeting recaps and handles voice-triggered messaging.

## Key Docs

- `docs/prd.md` — product requirements, features, edge cases
- `docs/tech-stack.md` — architecture, dependencies, project structure

## Stack

- Node.js 22 + TypeScript + Express
- `@whiskeysockets/baileys` for WhatsApp (QR auth, contacts, messaging)
- Single process, no database, in-memory state for MVP

## Conventions

- Keep it simple. This is a hackathon — working > elegant.
- No LLMs. Omi's `structured` payload already provides title, overview, and action items.
- One concern per file. Routes in `src/routes/`, services in `src/services/`, types in `src/types/`.
- Always handle the `uid` query parameter — it identifies the Omi user.
- Return `200 OK` quickly from webhooks. Do async work after responding when possible.
- Log with pino. Set level to `silent` for demo, `info` for dev.

## Endpoints

- `GET /setup` — QR code page for WhatsApp linking
- `GET /setup/status` — returns `{is_setup_completed: bool}` for Omi polling
- `POST /webhook/memory` — receives Omi memory, sends WhatsApp recap
- `POST /webhook/realtime` — receives live transcript, detects voice commands

## Edge Cases to Always Handle

- Skip discarded memories (`discarded: true`)
- Deduplicate real-time transcript segments by `session_id`
- Gracefully handle missing WhatsApp sessions (user not linked yet)
